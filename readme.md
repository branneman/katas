# Software Craftsmanship Katas in Clojure

To run these as-is, you'll need to have [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) installed. Then run from the terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:branneman/katas.git katas
cd katas
lein test
lein run fizzbuzz 1 100
lein run leapyears 2016
lein run rpn-calculator 3 5 8 \* 7 + \*
lein run roman-numerals 789
lein run hangman airplane ajkei
lein run wind N NE
lein run data-munging-weather
```

## FizzBuzz

Print the numbers between 1 and 100. If the number is divisible by 3, we want to print `Fizz` instead of this number. If the number is divisible by 5, we want to print `Buzz` instead. And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, we want to print `FizzBuzz`.

## LeapYears

Write a function that returns `true` or `false` depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not. A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

## RPN Calculator

An RPN calculator program computes expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation.

The RPN expression: `3 5 8 * 7 + *` equals: `3 * ((5 * 8) + 7)`

## Roman Numerals

Write a function to convert from decimal to roman numerals.

## ASCII Hangman

Given two words as input, where the words each match `[a-z]+`, output the current state of the hangman game as ASCII art. The first is to be guessed, the second word is the already-guessed letters.

## Wind directions

Given two cardinal wind directions, write a function that calculates the overlap: how much are they in the same direction?

Examples:

- If I am cycling towards North, and the wind is going towards South, then I have a 0% overlap with its direction. The function should return `0` when given `N` and `S`.
- If I am cycling towards North, and the wind is going towards North-East, then I have a 75% overlap with its direction. The function should return `0.75` when given `N` and `NE`.

# Data Munging

Part 1: In `bin/weather.dat` youâ€™ll find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for June 2002. Write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).
